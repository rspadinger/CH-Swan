# H01 - Statistics::variance - function will revert due to underflow if mean > data[i]

## Summary

**Link:** https://github.com/Cyfrin/2024-10-swan-dria/blob/c8686b199daadcef3161980022e12b66a5304f8e/contracts/libraries/Statistics.sol#L22

Variance should be calculated by squaring the difference between each data point and the mean. However, if mean > data[i], the following line will generate a panic error due to underflow:

```
uint256 diff = data[i] - mean;
```

## Vulnerability Details

**Proof of Concept:**

Add the following test file (eg: Statistics.test.ts) to the test folder and run the test by executing:

npx hardhat test --network hardhat test/Statistics.test.ts

```

## Impact

The faulty Statistics::variance function is called by Statistics::stddev, which is called by the private LLMOracleCoordinator::finalizeValidation function, which in turn is called by LLMOracleCoordinator::validate

This function is required to validate requests for a given taskId. Because of the vulnerability, most validations will fail, which prevents the protocol from functioning properly.


## Tools Used

Manual Review


## Recommendations

Modify the variance function

```diff
function variance(uint256[] memory data) internal pure returns (uint256 ans, uint256 mean) {
+   require(data.length > 0, "Data cannot be empty");
    mean = avg(data);
    uint256 sum = 0;
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {
+       int256 diff = int256(data[i]) - int256(mean);
+       sum += uint256(diff * diff);

-       uint256 diff = data[i] - mean;
-       sum += diff * diff;
    }

## Impact

The faulty LLMOracleCoordinator::finalizeValidation function is called by LLMOracleCoordinator::validate

This function is required to validate requests for a given taskId. Because of the vulnerability, some validations (depending on provided score values) will fail, which prevents the protocol from functioning properly.


## Tools Used

Manual Review


## Recommendations

Modify the for-loop in the finalizeValidation function:

```diff
for (uint256 v_i = 0; v_i < task.parameters.numValidations; ++v_i) {
    uint256 score = scores[v_i];
    
+   uint256 lowerBound = (_stddev <= _mean) ? _mean - _stddev : 0;
+   uint256 upperBound = _mean + _stddev;

-   if ((score >= _mean - _stddev) && (score <= _mean + _stddev)) {
+   if ((score >= lowerBound) && (score <= upperBound)) {
        innerSum += score;
        innerCount++;

        // send validation fee to the validator
        _increaseAllowance(validations[taskId][v_i].validator, task.validatorFee);
    }

# H03 - LLMOracleRegistry::unregister & LLMOracleCoordinator::finalizeValidation - the validator and generator allowances are correctly adjusted, but there is no function that allows to withdraw those fees / stake amounts

## Summary

https://github.com/Cyfrin/2024-10-swan-dria/blob/c8686b199daadcef3161980022e12b66a5304f8e/contracts/llm/LLMOracleCoordinator.sol#L369

The finalizeValidation and unregister function correcly adjusts the allowance for each validator/generator, but there is  no easy way for a validator/generator to retrieve the accumulated fees / stake amounts.

The docs state: "* Each oracle node can be thought of as an EOA that needs to register to the registry with some stake. The oracle can have two roles, `generator` or `validator`. They can register to both types if they would like to."

So, a validator/generator is an EOA and therfore it will be quite complicated to retrieve accumulated fees from the actual LLMOracleCoordinator/LLMOracleRegistry contract. A validator/generator would need to write a script using Ethers.js (or a similar library) that creates an instance of the fee token, connects with the corresponding validator/generator signer and calls the transferFrom method.

This, of course is unacceptable in terms of the user experience as most validators/generators would not be able to recover their fees.


## Impact

The current contract behavior prevents validators/generators from accessing their accumulated fees / stake amounts, potentially resulting in a permanent loss of earned rewards / stake amounts


## Tools Used

Manual Review


## Recommendations

**Remark:** The following code sections only cover possible solutions to recover validator fees - the same code can be used to recover generator fees.

To ensure that validators/generators can access their fee tokens, a mechanism needs to be implemented that allows them to withdraw their fees. There are two approaches:

**Direct Transfer to Validator:** Transfer the fee immediately within the loop instead of modifying the allowance. This approach is straightforward but may be less flexible if you want to aggregate validator earnings over multiple validations:

```diff
-   _increaseAllowance(validations[taskId][v_i].validator, task.validatorFee);

+   // Directly transfer the fee to the validator
+   address validator = validations[taskId][v_i].validator;
+   bool success = feeToken.transfer(validator, task.validatorFee);
+   require(success, "Fee transfer failed");
```

**Withdraw Pattern:** Track each validator's accumulated fees in the contract and allow them to withdraw their balance on demand. Implement a mapping to track each validator’s balance and a withdraw function:
 
```
mapping(address => uint256) public validatorBalances;
```

```diff


for (uint256 v_i = 0; v_i < task.parameters.numValidations; ++v_i) {
    uint256 score = scores[v_i];

+   uint256 lowerBound = (_stddev <= _mean) ? _mean - _stddev : 0;
+   uint256 upperBound = _mean + _stddev;

    if ((score >= lowerBound) && (score <= upperBound)) {
        innerSum += score;
        innerCount++;
        
-       _increaseAllowance(validations[taskId][v_i].validator, task.validatorFee);

+       // Accumulate the fee in validatorBalances
+       address validator = validations[taskId][v_i].validator;
+       validatorBalances[validator] += task.validatorFee;
    }
}
```

Add a withdraw function:

```
function withdrawFees() external {
    uint256 amount = validatorBalances[msg.sender];
    require(amount > 0, "No fees to withdraw");

    validatorBalances[msg.sender] = 0;

    bool success = feeToken.transfer(msg.sender, amount);
    require(success, "Transfer failed");
}

```


**For the LLMOracleRegistry::unregister functions, the following modifications are required:**

**Direct Transfer to the oracle:** Transfer the stake amount in the unregister function instead of modifying the allowance:

```diff
function unregister(LLMOracleKind kind) public returns (uint256 amount) {
    amount = registrations[msg.sender][kind];

    // ensure the user is registered
    if (amount == 0) {
        revert NotRegistered(msg.sender);
    }

    // unregister the user
    delete registrations[msg.sender][kind];
    emit Unregistered(msg.sender, kind);
 
-   token.approve(msg.sender, token.allowance(address(this), msg.sender) + amount);
+   bool success = token.transfer(msg.sender, amount);
+   require(success, "Transfer failed");
}
```

**Withdraw Pattern:** Track each oracle's accumulated stake amount in the contract and allow them to withdraw their balance on demand. Implement a mapping to track each oracle’s balance and a withdraw function:
 
```
mapping(address => uint256) public oracleBalances;
```

```diff
function unregister(LLMOracleKind kind) public returns (uint256 amount) {
    amount = registrations[msg.sender][kind];

    // ensure the user is registered
    if (amount == 0) {
        revert NotRegistered(msg.sender);
    }

    // unregister the user
    delete registrations[msg.sender][kind];
    emit Unregistered(msg.sender, kind);
 
-   token.approve(msg.sender, token.allowance(address(this), msg.sender) + amount);
+   // Accumulate the stake amount in oracleBalances
+   oracleBalances[msg.sender] += amount;
}
```

Add a withdraw function:

```
function withdrawFees() external {
    uint256 amount = oracleBalances[msg.sender];
    require(amount > 0, "No stake amount to withdraw");

    oracleBalances[msg.sender] = 0;

    bool success = token.transfer(msg.sender, amount);
    require(success, "Transfer failed");
}

```

# H01 - LSTRewardsSplitter::addFee - by accident, the same fee receiver could be added several times to the same RewardsSplitter

## Summary

**Link:** https://github.com/Cyfrin/2024-09-stakelink/blob/contracts/core/lstRewardsSplitter/LSTRewardsSplitter.sol#L141

There is no control...


## Vulnerability Details

Some details...

**Proof of Concept:**

Add the following test to lst-rewards-splitter.test.ts:

```
it.only('the same feeReceiver can be added several times to to a RewardsSplitter', async () => {
 
  assert.equal(fromEther(await token.balanceOf(accounts[6])), 40)
})
```

## Impact

This would cause an indirect loss of funds...


## Tools Used

Manual Review


## Recommendations

Modify the _withdraw function

```diff
function _withdraw(address _operator, uint256 _amount) private {
    uint256 sharesAmount = lst.getSharesByStake(_amount);
    shareBalances[_operator] -= sharesAmount;
    totalShares -= sharesAmount;
    
+   lst.transfer(_operator, _amount);

    emit Withdraw(_operator, _amount, sharesAmount);
}
```
