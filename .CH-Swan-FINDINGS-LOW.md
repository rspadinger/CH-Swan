# L01 - Missing initialization for upgradeable contracts: __UUPSUpgradeable_init

Missing initializers in upgradeable contracts can create security and functional risks, such as:

* Uninitialized State Variables

* Takeover Vulnerability: An attacker can deploy a proxy pointing to the uninitialized implementation contract and then call an initializer to take ownership. 

* Incorrect Contract State


## Recommendations

Add the following line of code to the initialize function in the LLMOracleCoordinator, LLMOracleRegistry and the Swan contract:

```
__UUPSUpgradeable_init()
```

# L01 - LSTRewardsSplitterController::removeSplitter - LSTRewardSplitter cannot be removed if there are undistributed rewards

## Link: https://github.com/Cyfrin/2024-09-stakelink/blob/f5824f9ad67058b24a2c08494e51ddd7efdbb90b/contracts/core/lstRewardsSplitter/LSTRewardsSplitterController.sol#L138


The function evaluates the current splitter balance:

```
uint256 balance = IERC20(lst).balanceOf(address(splitter));
```


## Proof of concept:

Add the following test to lst-rewards-splitter.test.ts: 

```
it('removeSplitter should fail if there are undistributed rewards', async () => {    
  const { accounts, controller, token, splitter0 } = await loadFixture(deployFixture)

  await token.transferAndCall(controller.target, toEther(100), '0x')
  await token.transfer(splitter0.target, toEther(100)) //simulate rewards

  await expect(controller.removeSplitter(accounts[0])).to.be.reverted
})
```


## Recommendations

Before calling splitter.withdraw... in the removeSplitter function, update the balance:

```
...
balance = IERC20(lst).balanceOf(address(splitter));
splitter.withdraw(balance, _account);
...
```
